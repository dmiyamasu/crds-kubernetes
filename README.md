# crds-kubernetes
Kubernetes Infrastructure for Crossroads

# Purpose

This repository contains all of the files used to set up the crossroads environment on a kubernetes cluster. This repository is deployed via our CI/CD pipeline (currently teamcity under the infrastructure/kubernetes project). Any environment variables seen in the files are replaced during the build and deploy process in TeamCity.

# Namespaces

The kubernetes cluster is broken into 3 separate namespaces. Each namespace contains it's own ingress controller and external IP address.

### Default

This namespace contains any front end applications and the routing to those applications via an ingress controller.

### API

This namespace contains back end applications and the routing to those applications via an ingress controller.

### kube-system

This namespace is built into the kubernetes deployment and contains some system applications. It also contains an ingress that exposes the kubernetes dashboard.
